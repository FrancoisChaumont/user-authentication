# User authentication - authenticate a user
PHP library to authenticate users verifying their credentials stored in a database.
This library provides a level of abstraction that allows it to be easily used with any database table/column definition.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements
PHP 7.0+ | MySQL/MariaDB 

### Installation
Just include the libraries and you are ready to go.

## Testing
Under the folder named *tests* you will find a SQL file and a test script ready to use.
The SQL file is a dump of a test database which the test script relies on.
